# 05-Challenge-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
A simple application that the user can utilize for planning daily activities during normal business hours. This app was constructed using JavaScript,
CSS, and a Bootstrap framework.

## Usage
The user will be greeted with a basic day planner upon loading the landing page. At the top of the page there is the current date and time that's displayed and will continuously update using moment().js. The user can then type what activities they'd like to schedule in the timeblock text boxes and save those plans to the local storage by clicking on the corresponding save buttons. The background color of the timeblocks will change if the time slots are in the future, present, or past when compared to the current time of day. The background colors will change to green if in the future, red if in the present, or white if in the past. Once the page is reloaded, it will display the schedule that was previously saved during the last session.
